Hereâ€™s the updated README file for your GainGuru project, with the code formatted properly:

GainGuru
GainGuru is a real-time stock trading platform that allows users to buy, sell, and track their stock portfolio. The app provides features such as real-time stock price fetching, a wallet system for adding or withdrawing money, and a profit/loss tracker. GainGuru fetches stock data from the Ventage API, which is limited to 25 API calls per day, so data is fetched twice a day using scheduled tasks.
